# knn-Classifier
Creating a k-Nearest Neighbors Classifer from scratch

In this project I have created K nearest neighbor Classifier from the scratch. K nearest neighbor classifier is a classifier which predicts the label of our test cases by finding the majority of exact same labels from the 'k' nearest labels in the vicinity of our test case.

While creating a knn classifier I realized the complexity of the algorithm and how it affects when the datasets are very large. Therefore that made me work on accelerated knn using 'Numba python' and 'pyCUDA'. Still that is a work in progress and any help or constructive feedbacks in this project are welcome.
